# Parts and kits

Smallest layout for Lithuanians is 50% ortho (almost nonexistant) or HHKB due to need to use numrow for Lithuanian symbols; Backslash key usually can be used as Delete, quite convenient and feels about right; Caps Lock can be used as Ctrl (for WKL/HHKB) or Fn key.

## 60% and HHKB  

![60](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99119828/163712333-63c4e7a8-f20b-402a-a63e-45e6f2667771.png)

*Perfect layout if you hate yourself. No Home/End keys, writing with it is as frustrating as it sounds.*

#### Kits

[BM60](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001329750229.html) Hotswap - OG 60%, QMK compatible but has north facing switches, probably the worst option

#### PCBs

[TF60](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/60-tf60-rgb-ansi-v1-hot-swap-mechanical-keyboard-pcb) Hotswap - OG 60% layout without arrow keys  
[TF60 V1](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/60-tf60-rgb-v1-hot-swap-pcb) Hotswap - 60% with arrow keys

[DZ60 Flex](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/60-dz60-v2-flex-cut-mechanical-keyboard-pcb) Solder - full support for 7U and WKL/HHKB, stepped Caps Lock, split Backspace, etc.  
[DZ60 Rev3](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/dz60-rev-3-0-60-mechanical-keyboard-pcb) Solder - quite same as Flex, just no flex cuts

[BT60](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/bt60-60-bluetooth-pcb) Solder & Hotswap - Bluetooth support, ZMK-based, might as well go and jump through the window

#### Cases

[Tofu60](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/kbdfans-tofu-60-aluminum-case) - aluminum brick, as simple as it gets; nonetheless, [O-rings mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQcdgUKV6dU) can lead to some very decent sound  
Tofu60 [E-White](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/kbdfans-tofu-60-case-e-white) and [E-Yellow](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/tofu-60-case-e-yellow-by-kbdfans) - same case but in pure white and yellow colors  
[Tofu60](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/60-plastic-case) plastic - cheap plastic case, gets the job done; comparison [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVD31ZTo-z40)  

[Blade60](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/blade60-aluminium-case) - interesting case, [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/px6rlb/blade60_build/) and [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/q246yn/vtuber_hoshimachi_suisei_themed_build_blade60_and/)

#### Plates

Just check same vendor when buying the case, should have some options.

*Additional column, usually used for 2xMacros + Home/End while using Delete on Backslash. Arrow blocker highly appreciated, helps when touch typing.*

#### Kits

KBD67 Lite R3 - [Keygem](https://keygem.store/products/r3-kbd67-lite-mechanical-keyboard-kit?_pos=3&_sid=8117d96e1&_ss=r) and [Candykeys](https://candykeys.com/product/kbd67-lite-r3-ANSI)  
[KBD67 MkII](https://candykeys.com/product/kbd67-mkii-kit) - simple full metal kit  
[KBD67 MkI](https://candykeys.com/product/kbd67-kit) - almost the same as MkII

[Keychron Q2](https://candykeys.com/product/keychron-q2-ansi) - exploded layout, chonky bezels, good gaskets, QMK/VIA support, decent stock stabs, good deal overall

[ID67](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002871249832.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_groupList.8148356.1.7175b037ix029l) - very stiff, quite pingy, requires modding  
[ID67 V2](https://keygem.store/collections/idobao/products/idobao-id67-v2) - has acrylic bottom, probably that's about it; integrated plate is quite stiff
[ID67 Crystal](https://keygem.store/collections/idobao/products/idobao-id67-crystal-ansi) - Acrylic or PC, gasket mounted

[Zoom65](https://mykeyboard.eu/search/?q=Zoom65) - one of the nicest kits in the market, has knob, looks not too cramped, good value

[BM65](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002133981307.html?) Hotswap - QMK, Screw In stabilizers, arrows blocker but north facing switches, not worth over KBD67 Lite

#### PCBs

[BT65](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/bt65-60-bluetooth-pcb) Solder & Hotswap - Bluetooth compatible, that's about it

[KBD67 Lite R3](https://www.eloquentclicks.com/product/pre-orders-kbd67-lite-r3-hotswap-pcb/) Hotswap - arrows blocker and hotswap, the nicest option

#### Cases

Tofu65 [E-White](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/tofu-65-case-e-white-by-kbdfans) - just pure white color

[KBD67 V3](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/kbd67-v3-gasket-mount-aluminum-case) Gasket Mount - gasket mounted, premium experience, expensive

## 75%

![7555](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99119828/163712347-8b9886b7-f184-4212-8cb9-801720ecd933.png)

*65% but with F Row if you need it, otherwise just a bit chonky looking layout.*

#### Kits

[KBD75 V3](https://candykeys.com/product/kbd75-v3-kit) - compact layout, cluster when it comes to arrow keys

ID80 - Candykeys [V1](https://candykeys.com/product/idobao-id80-75-hot-swappable-mechanical-keyboard), [V2](https://candykeys.com/product/idobao-id80v2) and [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000590804514.html)  
[GMMK Pro](https://www.kaina24.lt/search?q=gmmk+pro) - good looking but not too great gaskets implementation, cluster when it comes to QMK/VIA, Silver White isn't white actually, it's silver  
[Keychron Q1](https://candykeys.com/product/keychron-q1-ansi) - GMMK Pro alternative, better gaskets, QMK/VIA, requires some modding to remove pinging sounds, overall quite good typing experience  
[TEX Shinobi](https://candykeys.com/product/tex-shinobi-diy-kit-us-layout) - based on 7 Row Thinkpad keyboards, has Trackpoint and uses somewhat proprietary keycaps. Interesting kit but not so much flexibility except hot-swappable switches.

#### PCBs

[KBD75 Rev 2.0](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/kbd75-rev-2-0-pcb) Solder - compact layout, clustered arrow keys block, scuffed numpad support

[KBD75 V2](https://www.eloquentclicks.com/product/kbd75-v2-aluminum-case/) - with acrylic strip for RGB underglow

## 96% and 1800

![1800 board](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99119828/163672893-f354b05e-2a59-49d6-9c4d-0c8465a2bff3.png)

*96% looks cool and has more options, but lack of gaps between arrow keys and numpad makes user experience frustrating; 1800 avoids that but is even more obscure and almost non-existant.*

#### Kits

[ID96](https://keygem.store/collections/idobao/products/idobao-id96) - stiff integrated plate, pinging sound, needs a lot of modding  
[Melody 96](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32957159275.html) - heavy, thick, with acrylic bottom  
[YMDK 96](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32846088297.html) - floating design thus louder than the others  
[Epomaker GK96S](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002190954573.html) - hollow, white matte plate, awful proprietary software, lackluster Bluetooth supports, quite terrible experience; has [Southpaw](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002191357082.html) variant  

[Akko ACR98](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003541133996.html) - 1800 layout, floating design, loud, no QMK/VIA  
[Akko Mod 003](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003424229824.html) - gasket mounted, but still no QMK/VIA as well as no Screw-In stabilizers  
[BM980](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002509519466.html?) - QMK/VIA support, Screw-In stabilizers, north facing switches ,daughterboard for Type C, lowkey cheap case; mostly worth when making custom case for it, has potential to become budget-ish endgame  
[SAR](https://zambumon.com/sar/) - 1800 lovers' wet dream, probably will take a decade to come true

[Gamakay K77](https://www.banggood.com/GamaKay-K77-Mechanical-Keyboard-77-Keys-Hot-Swappable-Type-C-Wired-USB-3_1-NKRO-Translucent-Glass-Base-Gateron-Switch-RGB-Gaming-Keyboard-with-Numberpad-p-1852118.html?cur_warehouse=FR&ID=515634&rmmds=search) - technically, not a 1800, but it has an exploded layout and a numpad (no F Row tho). As other Gamakay models, it gives quite good results when [modded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20CoC2t-dic)

#### PCBs

[Melody96](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001838342437.html) - additional product for Melody 96 kit  
96% and 1800 market is quite scarce..

## Other

[YMDK Wings](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003330613995.html) - Arisu layout hotswap keyboard with QMK/VIA and Screw-In stabilizers; integrated plate - hollow and stiff, requires modding. PCB can be bought separately - both [Hotswap](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003456101595.html) and [Solder](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002460948806.html)

[ID75](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000311498726.html?) - ortholinear 75 keys keyboard with QMK; getting compatible keycaps is quite difficult unless choosing uniform XDA/DSA profiles

[Lily58](https://42keebs.eu/shop/kits/lily58-split-ergo-50-kit-black/) - rather cheap split keyboard kit, making your own case is suggested
