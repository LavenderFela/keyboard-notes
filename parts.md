# Parts and kits

Smallest layout for Lithuanians is 50% ortho (almost nonexistant) or HHKB due to need to use numrow for Lithuanian symbols; Backslash key usually can be used as Delete, quite convenient and feels about right; Caps Lock can be used as Ctrl (for WKL/HHKB) or Fn key.

## 60% and HHKB

*Perfect layout if you hate yourself. No Home/End keys, writing with it is as frustrating as it sounds.*

#### Kits

[BM60](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001329750229.html) Hotswap - OG 60%, QMK compatible but has north facing switches, probably the worst option

#### PCBs

[TF60](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/60-tf60-rgb-ansi-v1-hot-swap-mechanical-keyboard-pcb) Hotswap - OG 60% layout without arrow keys  
[TF60 V1](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/60-tf60-rgb-v1-hot-swap-pcb) Hotswap - 60% with arrow keys

[DZ60 Flex](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/60-dz60-v2-flex-cut-mechanical-keyboard-pcb) Solder - full support for 7U and WKL/HHKB, stepped Caps Lock, split Backspace, etc.  
[DZ60 Rev3](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/dz60-rev-3-0-60-mechanical-keyboard-pcb) Solder - quite same as Flex, just no flex cuts

[BT60](https://keygem.store/collections/pcb/products/bt60-60-bluetooth-pcb) Solder & Hotswap - Bluetooth support, ZMK-based, might as well go and jump through the window

#### Cases

[Tofu60](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/kbdfans-tofu-60-aluminum-case) - aluminum brick, as simple as it gets; nonetheless, [O-rings mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQcdgUKV6dU) can lead to some very decent sound  
Tofu60 [E-White](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/kbdfans-tofu-60-case-e-white) and [E-Yellow](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/tofu-60-case-e-yellow-by-kbdfans) - same case but in pure white and yellow colors  
[Tofu60](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/60-plastic-case) plastic - cheap plastic case, gets the job done; comparison [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVD31ZTo-z40)  

[Blade60](https://keygem.store/collections/case/products/blade60-aluminium-case) - interesting case, [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/px6rlb/blade60_build/) and [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/q246yn/vtuber_hoshimachi_suisei_themed_build_blade60_and/)

#### Plates

[Keychron Q2](https://candykeys.com/product/keychron-q2-ansi) - exploded layout, chonky bezels, good gaskets, QMK/VIA support, decent stock stabs, good deal overall

[ID67](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002871249832.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_groupList.8148356.1.7175b037ix029l) - very stiff, quite pingy, require modding  

[BM65](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002133981307.html?) Hotswap - QMK, Screw In stabilizers, arrows blocker but north facing switches, not worth over KBD67 Lite

#### Kits

[KBD75 V3](https://candykeys.com/product/kbd75-v3-kit) - compact layout, cluster when it comes to arrow keys

ID80 - Candykeys [V1](https://candykeys.com/product/idobao-id80-75-hot-swappable-mechanical-keyboard), [V2](https://candykeys.com/product/idobao-id80v2) and [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000590804514.html)  
[GMMK Pro](https://www.kaina24.lt/search?q=gmmk+pro) - good looking but not too great gaskets implementation, cluster when it comes to QMK/VIA, Silver White isn't white actually, it's silver  
[Keychron Q1](https://candykeys.com/product/keychron-q1-ansi) - GMMK Pro alternative, better gaskets, QMK/VIA, requires some modding to remove pinging sounds, overall quite good typing experience

[TEX Shinobi](https://candykeys.com/product/tex-shinobi-diy-kit-us-layout) - based on 7 Row Thinkpad keyboards, has Trackpoint and uses somewhat proprietary keycaps. Interesting kit but not so much flexibility except hot-swappable switches.
