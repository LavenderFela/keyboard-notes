# Keycaps

Different keycap profiles side by side

![profiles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99119828/163551518-a974d3ee-6c6f-4fc4-9b92-af74d8bb74c5.png)

*Cherry profile has interference with north facing PCBs, more and more switches have updated housings to prevent it, examples being Gateron Oil Kings, Gateron CJ, etc.; most people find XDA profile too flat for touch typing*

## Aliexpress

*Shipping takes forever especially in current situation; five side dye-sub keycaps sets are usually terrible, paint gets grooves over time and colors are off; GMK Doubleshot clones have wonky legends especially on modifier keys.*  
*Most reputable stores: KPRepublic, Real Eagles Trading Store, KBDFans Ali Store*
